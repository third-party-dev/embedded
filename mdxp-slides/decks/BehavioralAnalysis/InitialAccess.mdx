## End User Interfaces

Understand the *attack surface*.

- Web Browser
- HTTP(S) Access? (`curl` / `wget`)
- File Access? (`ftp` / `tftp`)
- System Monitoring? (`snmpget` / `snmpwalk`)
- System users? (`/etc/passwd`)
- Restricted or Standard Shells? (`telnet` / `ssh`)

## Root Access

<Block sx={{width:"70%"}}>

- Can you get *root* access to the system (e.g. enable SSH or telnet)?
- Can you get access to the system through unconventional means?
  - Jail break tools?
  - CVE Proof Of Concept?
  - Un-sanitized user input fields?

Remember, we attempting to find the easiest way to get at all the nitty 
gritty details of the system's internals. If we don't need to crack the box
the achieve this, then that can be a win.
