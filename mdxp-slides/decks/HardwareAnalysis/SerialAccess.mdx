## Internal UART

![ttl levels](./assets/ttl-levels.png)

- Many internal console UART connections are TTL.
- Can be identified by a header or paired holes coming from MCU.
- Typical baud rates: 115200, 9600, 38400.
- Common UART config: 8 bits, no parity, 1 stop bit (8-N-1)
- 2 wire TTL/UART uses software flow control.

## Measure Baud With LogicAn

<Block sx={{width: "70%"}}>

Given the microseconds (us) that a protocol takes to signal a single bit
of information, you can derive the baud with: 

`baud = (1/X) * 1000000`

Note: To get the sufficient accurate readings, you need to really crank up
the sample rate. At 8Mhz you can almost measure 115200 baud rates.
