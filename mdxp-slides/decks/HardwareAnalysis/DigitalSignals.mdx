## Clock Signals

![clock signal](./assets/clock-signal.png)

- Clock signals are a type of digital signal.
- Clock signals trigger actions based on time.
- Clocks *may* define how/when diginal data is read.

<Note>

- Mention that rizing and falling edges are represented as verticals but
  are not instantaneous.

</Note>

## Active High / Active Low

- Determined by how the signal is _activated_.
- Active low signals are high while deactivated.
- Active high signals are low while deactivated.
