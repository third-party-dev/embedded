## Common Toolchains

- GNU - The Gold Standard?
- Visual Studio (and MSVC)
- LLVM (Clang and LLD)

---

## Comparing GNU and Clang

- LLVM/Clang *still* depends on GNU for edge cases.
- LLVM can build for many architectures from a single install
- GNU usually requires a new install for each architecture family.
- GNU has been evolving organically since the 1980s.
- LLVM has had the opportunity to start from scratch.
- Both LLVM and GNU use "Single Static Assignment".
  - Many sites dispute this, referencing older GNU implementations.
